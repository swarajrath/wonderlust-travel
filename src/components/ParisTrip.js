                <h2>Paris</h2>
            Have you ever been to Paris? If not, then it's time to do it now with Studifahrten! If yes, then it's time to do it with Studifahrten again! :)

Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, fashion, science, and the arts. Paris is especially known for its museums: The Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world. You can see here tens of thousands of works of art - from Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek antiquities to masterpieces by artists such as da Vinci (including his incomparable Mona Lisa), Michelangelo and Rembrandt.

Are you ready to take your most beautiful picture in Paris with Eiffel tower? No one can imagine Paris without Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel has been the symbol of France and Paris for decades. More than 7 million people visit the Eiffel Tower every year.

You must also visit to Notre Dame Cathedral which is located in Paris's most visited part. This cathedral with upwards of 14 million visitors per year, is a masterpiece of French Gothic architecture.

On this trip you will also have a chance to see: Arc de Triomphe, Sacre-Coeur Cathedral, Musee d‚ÄôOrsay, Jardin du Luxembourg The Luxembourg Garden, Montmartre, the neighbourhood in which Sacre Coeur resides, and enjoy one of Paris‚Äô most authentic areas.

Visiting Sacr√©-C≈ìur is an incredible experience, and one of the most interesting place in Paris. You should listen musicians performance on the steps in from of the Basilica.

Whether you take a bite to eat for lunch or kick back on the public chairs and people watch, you‚Äôll be sure to enjoy the summer sunshine for a few hours.

Pont Alexandre III Surely this would have to be the prettiest bridge in the entire city! Running from the left to right bank of the seine, Pont Alexandre III also offers a great view of the Eiffel Tower.
